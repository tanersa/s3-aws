Date: 11/14/2021  S3 (Simple Storage Services)

1. Bucket names must be globally unique
2. Even though S3 is a global service we must choose the region from dropdown because of each regions data compliance/regulations
3. By default S3 buckets are private. (ACLs are blocked)
4. Again we have to build cost-optimized infrastructure. 
5. After certain time we need to move certain to to cheaper storage. For this we use S3 Lifecycle policies.


Prevent Accidential Deletion of data (Object) in S3 bucket.
1. For this we use Versioning.

How do you grant connectivity to S3 buckets without using Internet?
